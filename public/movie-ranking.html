<h1>The Best Movies According to Kris</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Lord of the Rings (Extended Trilogy)</h3>
<p>My favourite film trilogy of all-time. I love the cinematography, the acting, costume and set design, special effects, and most importantly the story. It is a timeless masterpiece. </p>

<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p> A mind bending, philosophical, metaphysical and existential action packed thriller. I've watched and rewatched it many times. </p>

<h3>Jurassic Park</h3>
<p>This 1993 classic started my obsession and love affair with all things dinosaurs and paleontology. The special effects and animatronics still hold up incredibly well to this day.</p>

<h3>Bonus: The Blues Brothers</h3>
<p>A hilarious comedy featuring comically insane car chases, while boasting a soulful bluesy soundtrack and many with many special guests appearances make for an extremely entertaining and rewatchable film.</p>
